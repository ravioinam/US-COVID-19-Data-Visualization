# US COVID-19 Data Visualization
(last updated 6 /6 / 2020)
 
The data used for this visualization is based on the John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The data repository is available at [this GitHub data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

This visualization only focus on the cases in the US. First the data was cleaned up and assigned the abbrebiated names of all the states in the US, so that we can plot the data on the map. Additional data cleanup and exploration was conducted. 

Checking the data:
